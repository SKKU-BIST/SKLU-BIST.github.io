Welcome to the introduction section. Here, we offer a comprehensive background on the project, detailing its goals, anticipated outcomes, and the fundamental principles guiding the approach. This section aims to provide the necessary context to understand the relevance and scope of the methods used.

In recent years, the development of digital twin technology has paved the way for creating virtual models that represent physical behaviors and environments. These models allow for real-time monitoring, predictive analysis, and optimization of various operations. This documentation explores how such technology can be effectively utilized within our framework, focusing on the creation and calibration of virtual models in a building management context.

Digital twins are widely regarded as transformative in fields such as construction, manufacturing, and urban planning. By accurately reflecting the real-world conditions of a building, digital twins can be used to simulate scenarios, predict outcomes, and respond to changes dynamically. Our project integrates these principles to create a robust digital environment that enhances building performance.
